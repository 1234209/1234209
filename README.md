Hi, I 'm bhagya Nanditha 👋
 
DevOps Engineer with 2.5+ years of hands-on experience supporting and automating production infrastructure across AWS cloud and on-prem data center environments. Strong background in Linux/Windows administration, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD automation, and container platforms.

Currently working at CTRLS Data Centers, where I manage business-critical systems, provision cloud and virtualized infrastructure, and build repeatable, reliable deployment pipelines. I have practical experience designing AWS environments (VPC, EC2, ALB, IAM, ECS), developing reusable Terraform modules, and enforcing environment isolation to reduce configuration drift and manual errors.

I actively work with Docker and Kubernetes to containerize and deploy applications, handle rolling updates, scaling, and troubleshoot production issues. I build and maintain Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, automate configuration using Ansible, and monitor systems using CloudWatch and basic Prometheus/Grafana, ensuring faster incident response and effective RCA.

AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, with a strong understanding of cloud security, networking, automation, and reliability engineering. Passionate about learning, improving system stability, and contributing to scalable cloud platforms.
